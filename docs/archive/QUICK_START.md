# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Run the Server Yourself

## ⚠️ Important
The server needs to be started manually in a terminal window. Automated startup is blocked by PowerShell execution policy.

---

## ✅ Simple 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Open Terminal
- Press `Windows Key + R`
- Type: `cmd` or `powershell`
- Press Enter

### Step 2: Navigate & Start
Copy and paste these commands one by one:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\Admin\OneDrive\Desktop\DEMO
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Wait & Open Browser
1. **Wait for this message:**
   ```
   ▲ Next.js 16.0.7
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
   - Ready in X.Xs
   ```

2. **Then open your browser:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)

---

## 🎯 That's It!

Your app should now be running!

---

## 🆘 If You See Errors

**Share the error message from the terminal** and I'll fix it immediately.

## 📝 Alternative: Use the Batch File

I've created `start-server.bat` for you. Just:
1. Double-click `start-server.bat`
2. Wait for "Ready" message
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`

---

**Status:** Ready to start! Just run `npm run dev` in a terminal window.
